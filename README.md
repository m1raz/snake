# ASCII snake (Windows console)

I have nothing to do. So I made an ASCII snake. =_="

# compile

Use g++. I used Code::Blocks 17.12 build in MinGW.

`g++ -Wall -fexceptions -g -std=c++11 -Ixlnt/include -lxlnt -c main.cpp -o snake.exe`

# play

# versions
v1.0 -> 
* well I made a game :D

1.1 -> 
* Snake head now is 'o' sign and body elem have '.' sign. Looks better. :3
* Background is black. Becouse '+' helps to orientate, but my eyes are so tired.

That's all, folks.
